I needed a portfolio for job hunting and thought to make my own page.

Using React would be overscoping and a static page would suffice,
so I focused on simple static html pages styled using TailwindCSS.

Adding minimal JavaScript allowed me to split the content up in multiple html files and load them on page load instead.
