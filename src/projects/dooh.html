        While I was working at Flarie our CTO approached me with a new project idea.
        It was simple: Take one of our existing games and make it playable on outdoors advertising screens.
        The idea was that passer-by's would see the ad and scan a QR code with their phone
        to be able to play the game on the actual advertising screen - but with their phone as a controller.

        Our first campaign on a very large screen -

        Many of these advertising screens have a 5G connection nowadays,
        but we had to figure out how to communicate with it in a sticky session.
        The result was a QR code that would generate a token for the user that opened the webpage,
        send this to the screen that would then initiate a connection with the user's device,
        and finally run an instance of the game.
        The webpage on the user's device simply displayed one or more buttons that would be sent as commands
        to the game running on the screen.

        I ended up building a modular system that allowed us to easily add more of our games to the list of
        screen-playable games with only minimal configuration for the campaign.
        But alas there was a very noticable input delay that made the games feel very unfair for the player.
        We ended up only doing a few of these campaigns, but in the end it is one of the coolest project I have been a part of!
