        The Framework is a shared file every game uses.
        It serves the purpose of letting the game developers focus on the game idea
        and not have to spend time writing/copying/modifying the same functions over again.
        It has grown to be a huge project that supports multiple game modes on multiple platforms
        for every different type of game conceivable in the Flarie library.
        <br>
        The Framework also holds the UI that all games display, which consists of:
      </p>
      <ul class="modal-list leading-none">
        <li>
          <span class="modal-list-title">Scorebar</span>:
          This holds the current score, any lives, stars, moves remaining, and a colored visual timer.
        </li>
        <li>
          <span class="modal-list-title">Coins display</span>:
          Simply tells the users how many coins they have accrued so far in the game round.
          It may also serve as a filled container for sessions that have a target score to reach.
        </li>
        <li>
          <span class="modal-list-title">Pause button & Pause view</span>:
          A simple button that opens up a screen-covering interface while pausing the game.
          The pause view shows the tutorial text and lets the user exit the game or resume.
        </li>
        <li>
          <span class="modal-list-title">Preview page</span>:
          Before the game begins we display the latest score achieved and the PLAY button to begin the game.
        </li>
        <li>
          <span class="modal-list-title">And more..</span>
          Depending on the game, game mode, and platform, the framework UI would adapt.
        </li>
      </ul>

        When I first joined Flarie they had about 50 games in their app and I noticed that each game had some identical functions in them.
        I set about creating a new file, the 'Framework', that would hold all of these shared functions.
        At first this was just a global script dumping functions in to the DOM,
        but during a later rewrite it became a class object.
        <br>
        What began as a bare-bones collection of necessary functions for each game
        eventually grew to alleviate other common trends I noticed in the game code.
        Say some of the games had pickups in them where the developer wanted a particle emitter effect,
        well then the framework would have a function that simplified this process to a single function call
        with parameters to modify common settings.
        Always returning the object to allow for chaining or further modification.
      </p>
      <img src="images/gamescreens.png" class="modal-image max-w-lg" onclick="this.classList.toggle('max-w-lg'); this.classList.toggle('max-w-full');"/>
      <p class="modal-image-description">Preview Page | Game View | Adventure Level View</p>
      <p class="modal-paragraph">
        Looking back it is clear to me how the Framework grew and matured while I myself grew as a developer.
        When I learned new things I would use them in the Framework to make it more efficient and helpful.
        I distinctly remember the day I changed all the multi-parameter functions to instead use just one parameter object
        where the developer could provide only the properties they wanted to.
