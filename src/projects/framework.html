        The Framework is a shared file every game uses.
        It serves the purpose of letting the game developers focus on the game idea
        and not have to spend time writing/copying/modifying the same functions over again.
        It has grown to be a huge project that supports multiple game modes on multiple platforms
        for every different type of game conceivable in the Flarie library.
      </p>
      <p class="modal-paragraph">
        The Framework also holds the UI that all games display, which consists of:
        * The scorebar:
          This holds the current score, any lives, stars, moves remaining, and a colored visual timer.
        * The coins display:
          Simply tells the users how many coins they have accrued so far in the game round.
          It may also serve as a filled container for sessions that have a target score to reach.
        * The pause button & view:
          A simple button that opens up a screen-covering interface while pausing the game.
          The pause view shows the tutorial text and lets the user exit the game or resume.
        * Preview page:
          Before the game begins we display the latest score achieved and the PLAY button to begin the game.
        * And more..
          Depending on the game, game mode, and platform, the framework UI would adapt.

        When I first joined Flarie they had about 50 games in their app and I noticed that each game had some identical functions in them.
        I set about creating a new file, the 'Framework', that would hold all of these shared functions.
        At first this was just a global script dumping functions in to the DOM,
        but during a later rewrite it became a class object.

        What began as a bare-bones collection of necessary functions for each game
        eventually grew to alleviate other common trends I noticed in the game code.
        Say some of the games had pickups in them where the developer wanted a particle emitter effect,
        well then the framework would have a function that simplified this process to a single function call
        with parameters to modify common settings.
        Always returning the object to allow for chaining or further modification.

        Looking back it is clear to me how the Framework grew and matured while I myself grew as a developer.
        When I learned new things I would use them in the Framework to make it more efficient and helpful.
        I distinctly remember the day I changed all the multi-parameter functions to instead use just one parameter object
        where the developer could provide only the properties they wanted to.
