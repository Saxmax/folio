        I was asked to develop a prototype, and eventually a finished product,
        that would allow us to develop games for a real-time multiplayer experience at Flarie.
        The Flarie games are hypercasual so the multiplayer experience needs to not only adhere to that
        but also to allow users jumping in and out of the game at any point.
        We used Phaser 2D as a game engine which is pure code, no editor, and comes with no plugins or pre-made
        libraries for networking.
      </p>
      <p class="modal-paragraph">
        I iterated many prototypes using multiple different socket api's and system designs
        over a project that spanned two years.
        I was not making ONE multiplayer game, in an editor that came with plugins
        or tools to accomplish this. I was making a multiplayer service that would allow
        our game developers to focus on making games without worrying about networking and the backend.
      </p>
      <p class="modal-paragraph">
        The project ended up using Node.js to run PM2 on the backend - which could boot up multiple instances of node on one CPU -
        with a custom backend system written in JavaScript to handle game instances, lobbys, player id's & connections, player parties (groups), invite codes,
        and much more.
        I also developed a multiplayer framework that would handle the networking part of the game and common features games would need.
      </p>
      <p class="modal-paragraph">
        Alongside all the backend work I needed to build a game as well,
        which requires not only gameplay but client-prediction, input lag compensation, server authority, and more.
        The game I created was heavily inspired by the popular online mobile game Snake.io.
        This was a simple enough game that allowed jumping in and out freely, and was proven to work since it was already trending on the app stores.
      </p>
      <p class="modal-paragraph">
        The game ended up never launching and the live beta did not get much attention from our user base nor clients.
        After months of optimizations and refactors, the servers our DevOps provided were not capable of handling real-time game connections.
        And since there was not much demand for it from players and customers it was hard to motivate the costs of upgrading the servers.

        I learned so very much from this project.
        I had to manage my time, create tickets and plan sprints, set goals and playtests sessions,
        and also research a lot since I have never worked with networking before.
        There were many struggles along the way - I almost got burned out from putting too much pressure on myself over time.
        Keep in mind that I had no clue of what I was doing, and I was developing this by myself. No team, no lead, no senior guidance.
        In retrospect, this project is what made me break out of impostor syndrome and confidently feel that I now deserve the Senior title.
