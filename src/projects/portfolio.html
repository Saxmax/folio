        Since I got my first, and only, job as a developer via contacts right after University
        I have not had a portfolio previously.
        Even though I have set up many WordPress sites before I wanted to try creating a simple
        portfolio page myself.
      </p>
      <p class="modal-paragraph">
        I decided to create a static webpage with a simple design.
        After some googling I found that TailwindCSS seemed easy to work with,
        and I also found Coolors.com that helped with picking a palette to use.
      </p>
      <p class="modal-paragraph">
        I use a bit of JavaScript to fetch pages on page load - this lets me keep the index file short and clean,
        and I can focus on the other pages in separate files.
        The same is true for the project cards, too. They each have their own html file.
        I found this to be a nice structure with intuitive separation.
        I also use JavaScript to toggle the clickable images in the project pages.
      </p>
      <p class="modal-paragraph">
        Since some pages were fetched by JavaScript I turned the project in to a Node.js project.
        This lets me host the page locally using npm package serve during development,
        and I could install Tailwind as a package instead of loading it via CDN.
        It also lets me build the project, which is actually only required for Tailwind to build a file with
        only the used CSS properties and my custom CSS properties.
