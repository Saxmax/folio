  <!-- <p class="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed whitespace-pre-line font-sans">
    Hi, I'm Max. A senior developer with 7 years professional experience.

    I graduated Game Design & Scripting at Södertörn University back in 2008
    and landed a job at a mobile advergaming company doing a great many things:
    - Building hypercasual mobile games
    - Further developing and maintaining the internal framework
    - Created a product where games could be played on out-of-home screens
    - Solo developed a real-time multiplayer webgame experience

    And I have also worked on small hobby projects over the years to scratch that developer itch.
    You can read more about all of these projects in the section below.

    Besides problem solving code I enjoy problem solving climbing routes in my free time, I live with an old lady of a cat, I enjoy spending time with my friends, and of course playing video games - mostly survival/crafting!
