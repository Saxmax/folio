    Hi, I'm Max. A senior developer with 7 years professional experience.

    I graduated Game Design & Scripting at Södertörn University back in 2018
    and landed a job at a mobile advergaming company doing a great many things:

    <ul class="about-list">
      <li>Building hypercasual <span class="about-list-keyword">mobile games</span></li>
      <li>Further developing and maintaining the <span class="about-list-keyword">internal framework</span></li>
      <li>Created a product where games could be played on <span class="about-list-keyword">out-of-home screens</span></li>
      <li>Solo developed a <span class="about-list-keyword">real-time multiplayer webgame</span> experience</li>
    </ul>
  </p>

    And I have also worked on small hobby projects over the years to scratch that developer itch.
    You can read more about all of these projects in the section below.

    Besides problem solving code I enjoy problem solving climbing routes in my free time,
    I live with my old lady cat, I enjoy spending time with my friends,
    and of course playing video games - mostly survival/crafting!
